## What is Elixir?

Elixir is a functional , concurrent , general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir compiles on top of Erlang to provide distributed, smooth, fault-tolerant, non-stop real-time applications, but also extends it to support metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.
